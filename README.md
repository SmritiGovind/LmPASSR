Lightweight Stereo Image Super resolution using modified PAM 

This paper proposes a lightweight stereo image super-resolution method using modified parallax attention (LmPASSR), which enhances the utilization of stereo information. This is achieved through a modified occlusion mask that filters out irrelevant attention values. Additionally, the model incorporates depth-wise convolutions, implemented as D-blocks, to minimize parameter usage.
